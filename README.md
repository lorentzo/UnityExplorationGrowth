# Unity Exploration Growth

Concept:
* Small planet with water spring
* Player (like in Black&White 2) takes water from spring and makes rain
* Where it is raining, there plants grow and turn tu green
* Plants after some time dry and change color to yellow

TODOs:
* Player with raycast spawns plants on regions defined by noise
* Instances must have random scale, rotation and position
* Make sure to preserve the scale of instances
